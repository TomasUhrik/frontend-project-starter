# Coding assignment

## Instructions
Create a simple landing page. Your goal is to code it exactly based on the designs provided. Form with comments should be functional, including reply buttons (use javascript for that). The landing page should be fully responsive.

## Progress
Commit all your changes to a `dev` branch. When you are ready to submit your assignment for a review, create a `pull request` from `dev` to `master` and in the right column select your mentor as a reviewer.

You can find your mentor [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15yT3F4OtwyqCiow9syuPS9vqaanjlHJcHKSkExQgvhA/edit#gid=1544649426).
